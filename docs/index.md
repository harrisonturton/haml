# Haml

`Haml` is an experimental **configuration metalanguage**. It is used to
describe the syntax and types that may be used in your configuration files, and
then parse and typecheck them. This is helpful for abstracting over a problem
domain that may evolve over time as you add new features.

This is especially useful for sophisticated code-generation tasks like those
tackled by OpenAPI and proto files. If you've ever wished the OpenAPI spec was
*slightly* different, you're in the right place.
